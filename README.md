# Overview
A business focused on providing essential services to foreign students interested in studying in Egypt is being launched.
The business targets students primarily from Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Syria. Given the limited marketing budget,
the key challenge is determining how to effectively allocate resources to attract the target audience.

## Key Project Questions
1) Can the business focus its media buying efforts solely on Saudi Arabia while still attracting qualified leads from other nationalities (Yemen, Sudan, Syria)?
2) Which cities in Saudi Arabia should be prioritized for maximum impact if traditional marketing efforts will be involved, like school visits, educational exhibitions, or higher education events?
3) What is the gender ratio of the targeted market (a way to determine family influence factor into decision-making for studying abroad)?
4) The current age range is set between 18-31. Can this range be further narrowed?
5) What are most interesting studying fields for targeted students to design a proper campaign?

## Data Source
+400 Students' Information collected from an awareness campaign where participants visited the project's website and filled out a form with essential data used for this analysis.

## Following an extensive market analysis, several important insights have emerged
1) Most of students from Yemen, Syria, and Sudan who can afford to live abroad have often already left their home countries due to ongoing conflicts and challenging economic conditions. [Those still residing in these countries are likely seeking scholarships], which the business does not currently offer.
2) For many students currently living in Saudi Arabia, Egypt presents an appealing option for higher education due to its lower cost of living and relatively stable environment compared to their home countries. Students from war-torn nations (Yemen, Syria, Sudan) may also find Egypt attractive given these comparative advantages.

## Conclusion
Given the available insights and the limited marketing resources, it is more cost-efficient to concentrate media buying efforts in Saudi Arabia.

## The reasoning is twofold:

1) Many qualified students from Yemen, Syria, and Sudan are already residing in Saudi Arabia, making it a strategic hub for reaching these nationalities.
2) By targeting Saudi Arabia, the business can also tap into the local Saudi student population as well as potentially discover other nationalities, such as Indian or Malaysian students, who may have an interest in studying in Egypt.

## Finally, Risk Factors of Targeting Yemen, Syria, and Sudan Directly
Marketing directly to students in Yemen, Syria, and Sudan carries significant risks. The students in these countries are more likely to be seeking scholarship opportunities, which are not part of the current service offerings.

# Results:
- A 24:76 ratio of Saudi to non-Saudi students suggests focusing on the Saudi market would be cost-effective given limited resources in first season.
- 65% of students are from Riyadh and Jeddah, making these cities ideal for targeted traditional marketing.
- 86% of students are aged 17-24, allowing the age range to be narrowed from 18-31 to 17-24.
- 59% of interested students are female.
- 50% are interested in studying medicine, 17% in engineering, and 33% in other fields.
